__Date and time__: 02.04.2025, 18:15-20:45 (2.5hr)

## Instructions

Julia (version 1.11.4): for all operating systems it is best is to use
"juliaup":
https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup

The course uses VSCode as editor and development environment where a
script can be executed line-by-line. Install it and the Julia plugin:
https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode#installing-juliavs-codevs-code-julia-extension

If you have another preferred editor, that is fine too, but look into
getting the Julia-environment setup:
